        <h2>The main Goal</h2>
            <p>"Hello World", is what I would not say. That's a bit lame, but that's just my two cents.
                Since I live in Canada, I guess my two cents get rounded down to zero so just ignore my previous statement.
                It's just that too many programming tutorials use "Hello World".
                I get it, it's the first step, but aren't there other ways to approach this?
                Why not: greetings Nathan, you are a great programmer and I would like to hire you?
                I've yet to see these kind of statements, and frankly I intend to do something about it.
                I'm not sure how, but I just know that this site is the start of it.
                Once I master HTML, CSS, AND Js then we'll see who has the last laugh Akira!
